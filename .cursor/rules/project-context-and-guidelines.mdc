## About the course

You have been asked to create a course on PHP for a group of students who are
new to web development with PHP. They already have a small background in HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript as well as some modest experience with other programming
languages such as Java.

The students will be expected to use PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQLite to create the
application. They will also be expected to follow best practices for web
development, including code organization, and accessibility.

The goal of the course is to provide students with a solid foundation in PHP
programming and prepare them for more advanced topics in web development for
future courses.

The course will be delivered in a series of lectures, tutorials, and exercises
over a period of 6 weeks. The course will be taught in French so all course
material and lectures must be in French but all code must be in English. The
students will be expected to complete weekly assignments and create a final
project to demonstrate their understanding of the material.

## Your tasks

You are responsible for creating the course materials, including lectures,
tutorials, exercises, and assignments. You will also be responsible for
evaluating the students' progress and providing feedback on their work.
